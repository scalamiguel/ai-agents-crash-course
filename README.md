# 7-Day AI Agents Crash-Course
In this course, we're building intelligent systems that can understand and interact with data.
We'll create a conversational agent that can answer questions about any GitHub repository - think of it as a personal AI assistant for documentation and code. If you know DeepWiki, it's something similar, but tailored to your GitHub repo.
For that, we need to:
Download and process data from the repo
Put it inside a search engine
Make the search engine available to our agent
In the first half of the course, we will focus on data preparation. On day 1 we will do the first part: downloading the data.
