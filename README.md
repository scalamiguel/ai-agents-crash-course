# 7-Day AI Agents Crash-Course

## Day 1: Ingest and Index Your Data
In this course, we're building intelligent systems that can understand and interact with data.

We'll create a conversational agent that can answer questions about any GitHub repository - think of it as a personal AI assistant for documentation and code. If you know [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.org/), it's something similar, but tailored to your GitHub repo.

For that, we need to:
- Download and process data from the repo
- Put it inside a search engine
- Make the search engine available to our agent

In the first half of the course, we will focus on data preparation. On day 1 we will do the first part: downloading the data.

### GitHub Repo Data
On the first day, we will learn how to download and process data from any GitHub repository. We will download the data as a zip archive, process all the text data from there, and make it available for ingesting it later into a search engine.

Think of this as preparing a meal - we need to gather and prep all our ingredients (the data) before we can cook (build our AI agent).

Today, we will deal with simple cases, when documents are not large.

Tomorrow we will deal with more complex cases when documents are big and we also have code.
