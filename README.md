# 7-Day AI Agents Crash-Course
In this crash course we will learn how to build intelligent systems that can understand and interact with your data.

## Day 1: Ingest and Index Your Data
On the first day, we will learn how to download and process data from any GitHub repository.

We will download the data as a zip archive, process all the text data from there, and make it available for ingestion into a search engine later.

Today, we will address simple cases where documents are not large.
